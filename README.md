# Authentication System
This is an authentication system rewritten from IT145 into WPF using C#.Net and an MVVM design pattern.
The project addresses three main concepts in the program.
* Software Design and Engineering
* Algorithms and Data Structures
* Databases
### Software Design and Engineering
 Translate the application from Java to C#.Net and incorporate the MVVM design pattern with WPF

### Algorithms and Data Structures
 Use more secure hashing algorith for passwords and incorporate user locks for max attempts rather than just closing the program

### Databases
 Store the credentials in a relational database management system instead of a plain text file and query for valid credentials upon login request
